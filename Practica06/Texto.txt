 The increasing use of digital technology presents a challenge for existing storage capabilities. The need for a reliable and long-term solution for information storage is further heightened by the prediction that the current magnetic and optical storage will become unrecoverable within a century or less. DNA is a compact, long-term, and proven medium for information storag. Indeed, over the last few decades, a good case has been made for crucial information storage in DNA. Desirable properties of DNA include its capacity for long-term information storage and recovery, which are mostly independent of technological changes, the ability to conceal data in a miniaturized fashion and its ability to be transferred, when required, via self propagation. Various approaches for information coding in DNA have been reported, including the Huffman code, the comma code, and the alternating code, a straight coding based on 3 bases per letter, or sequential conversion of text to keyboard scan codes followed by conversion to hexadecimal code and then conversion to binary code with a designed nucleotide encryption key. Each approach o ers advantages and inherent difficulties, and differs in the degree of economical use of nucleotides. We sought to develop an alternate approach for information archiving in DNA. We used the principles of the Huffman code to de ne DNA codons for the entire keyboard, for unambiguous information coding.

 Binary space partitions are an interesting application of trees that has been used in rendering for computer graphics, collision detection for mobile robots, and computer games (it was used in the Doom engine). The basic idea is to recursively partition the space of interest (e.g., the game field) into smaller and simpler polygons (or polyhedra, in general) until each partition is empty of objects other than on the partitioning boundaries.
